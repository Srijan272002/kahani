when clicking on any card of the movies page it diverts me back to dashboard
when clicking on tv shows it diverts me back to dashboard
when clicking on any books books detail page should come
change the theme of movies,books, tv shows page to black and red

see now the plan for movies diffrent genres should come for tv series also and for books and dont keep icons for that just text and give more and keep the functionality user doesnt have to decide genre it should be optional

in the navbar remove the search and add name of the website Kahani instead of your company instead of dashboard name it Prompt Page

increase the size of the prompt box its too small

i have the new plan now for prompt page make prompt box inside that give option for movies, tv shows and books and get recommendation button and keep the genres thing as it is

in setting page only show

- Profile Info (Name,Avatar)
- Security & Privacy

shift navabar to left side
prompt page make it compact
